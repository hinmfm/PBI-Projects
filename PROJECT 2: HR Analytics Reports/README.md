## Acknowledgements
Dr. Carla Patalano and Dr. Rich Huebner are the original authors of this dataset.

Dr. Carla Patalano provided the baseline idea for creating this synthetic data set, which has been used now by over 200 Human Resource Management students at New England College of Business.

## Analysis Objectives
HR data can be challenging to access, and HR professionals typically lag in analytics and data visualization skills. This project aims to establish and oversee HR metrics, perform basic analyses of workforce data to reveal trends and patterns, and offer data-driven recommendations to HR leaders to aid in strategic decision-making.

## Analysis Purpose
There are several questions this analysis seeks to answer, including:
- Is there any relationship between who a person works for and their performance score?
- What is the overall diversity profile of the organization?
- What are our best recruiting sources if we want to ensure a diverse organization?
- Can we predict who is going to terminate and who isn't? What level of accuracy can we achieve on this?
- Are there areas of the company where pay is not equitable?

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* MS Excel 2016:
* MS PowerBI
