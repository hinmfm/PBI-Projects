###### It is highly recommended that the pbix file be downloaded for clearer details.

## Analysis Purpose
This project's main aim is to raise awareness on the state of multiple unrests and rebels occuring from 1970 to 2017 (due to limitations from the data source). Moreover, the noteworthy higher frequency of terrorism attacks happening and the occurrence of extremists, such as the Houthis and the Hamas also contribute to the project's main purpose.

## Analysis Findings
In the following project, I seek for global hotspots with the global map visualized. Additionally, I also want to determines whether the media accurately address the most dangerous extremist groups as well as find out the most destructive weapons used. 

These aforementioned findings would be used for fortification of national defense and making sure UNICEF army be sent to hotspots to prevent war and social unrest as well as the most affected nations could receive help and aids. Lastly, research on most destructive weapons could be used against themselves, as when statistics are available, people can understand more on the underlying damage of them and manufacturers, nations and etc. could limit their use and production.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* MS Excel 2016:
* MS PowerBI 

## Analysis Results

1. Global hotspots: South Asia; Middle East & North Africa
2. Deadliest terrorist groups & most destructive weapons: ISIL/Taliban & Explosives (respectively)
3. Solutions: sending troops to extreme regions for army fortification, supporting countries most affected by terrorism, and limiting the act of selling weapons to arm extremists.
